# opnotes-project

Opnotes is a notes-app created with the Django web development framework, and python.
It is a small project to learn about Django and web development

<h3>OpNotes - Notes for optimists<h3>

* "OpNotes" name sounded cool to me and the line "Notes for Optimists" was soo professional sounding.
It is a notes taking app with CRUD functionality, and user authentication and served with user specific
data. It uses Django on the backend, css for styles and html for the templates.

It has a Heroku Postgres database, so it is usable.
