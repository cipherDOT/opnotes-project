<h3>OpNotes - Notes for optimists<h3>

<p>"OpNotes" name sounded cool to me and the line "Notes for Optimists" was soo professional sounding.
It is a notes taking app with CRUD functionality, and user authentication and served with user specific
data. It uses Django on the backend, css for styles and html for the templates.</p>

<p>It has a Heroku Postgres database, so it is usable.</p>
